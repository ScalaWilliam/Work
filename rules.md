- Price too low? Ask for more.
- I will post the price I'm happy to pay.
- Click on "I'm interested" link to mail me.
- Do not do any work until we're agreed.
- This is not employment. No obligations from me nor from you.
   - You are not obliged to accept work.
   - I am not obliged to offer work.
   - I am not obliged to pay you if I'm not happy.
   - I do not take any taxation responsibility.
   - Small units of work = less risk than going to an interview.
- Large units of work? Split it up, create issues. See below.
- I'll pay via PayPal, bank transfer, AliPay, WeChat or any other convenient alternative.
- Don't make changes not asked for unless they are essential or part of the job.
  - Version upgrades make validation more difficult. I can be on a bad internet connection, don't want to download many JARs
  - Logic changes may require extra time for me to validate. Instead, create an issue as below.
- Please reference the Issue in the PR, so that I can get to the PR via the Issue.

## Create issue, get paid!

Have ideas? **Create work for yourself!**

- You want to work on something but there's no issue? Create one.
- If I like it, I pay $5.00 for the creation.
- You suggest your own price, then I will either agree or lower it.
- Then you can take on it as usual.
