## Complete a piece of work, get paid

Here I post up pieces of work that are beyond my capacity but I want to get done.

This is a perfect way to get extra income and build up open source experience.

## Rules

- I will post the price I'm happy to pay.
- Click on "I'm interested" link to mail me.
- If you want more money, say so.
- Do not do any work until we're agreed.
- This is not employment. No obligations from me nor from you.
   - You are not obliged to accept work.
   - I am not obliged to offer work.
   - I am not obliged to pay you if I'm not happy.
   - I do not take any taxation responsibility.
   - Small units of work = less risk than going to an interview.
