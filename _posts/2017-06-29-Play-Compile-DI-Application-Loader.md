title: "$50: Migrate ActionFPS to use Compile time DI: Application Loader module"
layout: post
---

- Price: $50
- Issue: [github.com/ScalaWilliam/ActionFPS/issues/400](https://github.com/ScalaWilliam/ActionFPS/issues/400)
- Skills: Scala, Play Framework

## Scope
Implement an application loader. Keep other parts of the system in Runtime DI - I want incremental work only - we migrate those parts later, separately.

Incremental work only, no large PRs :-)
